# HDL_DUMP Batch Utility V1.0
Batch utility to automate installing of PS2 ISO files at once onto a PS2 formatted hard drive and is written in .Net Core 3.0.

# Instructions
-The batch installer will install any .iso files present in the working directory of the batch installer.

-You will need to manually seperate CD and DVD iso's as the batch installer can only do one type at once, it cannot do a mixture. So if you have a mixture of DVD and CD Iso's then seperate them into different folders and simply run the batcher once from each of the folders.

-hdl_dump_092.exe is required to be in the same folder as HDL_Dump_Batcher.exe

-Simply connect your PS2 Hdd and run HDL_Dump_Batcher.exe as admin and follow the on screen prompts.

# Side notes
-This program is as is, it is no means perfect and has limited error handling.
